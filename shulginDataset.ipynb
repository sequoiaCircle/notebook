I moved into the creative, free-flowing kind of repertoire which I dearly love, and found everything enormously funny.  Much of the laughter was so deep that I felt it working through buried depressions inside me and freeing me.  From this point on, the experience was most enjoyable. The experience was characterized by clear-headedness and an abundance of energy which kept on throughout the day and evening.  At one point I went out back and strolled along to find a place to worship.  I had a profound sense of the Presence and great love and gratitude for the place, the people, and the activities taking place.  The come-down from the experience was very gradual and smooth.
