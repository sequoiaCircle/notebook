When TLC analysis indicated\\nthat the nor-LSD had been consumed (30 min) all volatiles were removed\\nunder a hard vacuum. The residue was solubilized in CHCl3 (5x5 mL) and\\nthe pooled extracts dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 which was remove by\\nfiltration. The filtrate removed under vacuum leving a residual white\\nsolid. This was separated into two components by centrifugal\\nchromatography (alumina, CH2Cl2, nitrogen and ammonia atmosphere), the\\nfirst of which was the major product. After removal of the solvent,\\nthis was dissolved in hot benzene, filtered and cooled. The addition\\nof hexane prompted crystallization of AL-LAD (N-allyl-nor-LSD) as a\\nwhite crystalline product weighing 66 mg, yield 88%. It had a mp of\\n88-90&#176C and an [a]D + 41.8 (c 0.44, EtOH).\\nDOSAGE : 80 - 160 micrograms\\nDURATION : 6 - 8 h.\\nQUALITATIVE COMMENTS : (with 50 µg) \"I am aware in twenty\\nminutes, and am into a stoned place, not too LSD like, in another\\nhour. I would very much like to push higher, but that is not in the\\ncards today and I must acknowledge recovery by hour eight.\"\\n\\n(with 80 µg) \"I had a mild effect, although the doors to my repressed\\nfeelings somehow really become opened up. There was nothing\\ntranscendental here, but there were moments where I felt a conscious\\nseparation from the world about me. None of the profound meanings that\\nI had hoped to have explained were explained.\" \\n\\n(with 150 µg) \"I felt it in less than a quarter hour, and was shooting\\nup past a +++ in another quarter hour. Fast. Just like LSD but without\\nthe vaguely sinister push. A little time slowing, randy, no body\\ndisturbance. Dropping at six hours and totally tired and going to\\nsleep at twelve hours.  I will repeat.\"\\n\\n(with 150 µg) \"Simply beautiful. Erotic and music absorption after\\nsecond hour. Clear thinking with superb imagery and good\\ninterpretation. Easy, gentle sleeping. Next day -- serene,\\nclear-thinking peacefulness. One of the best materials ever.\"\\n\\n(with 160 µg) \"I took 160 ug at 11 AM on an empty stomach and lay down\\nto listen to a hypnotic relaxing tape, with eye shades and headphones.\\nThe onset was very gradual over two or three hours. There was some\\nvisual distortion similar to LSD, but mild. I decided that this was\\nabout as intense as it was going to get, so I lay down in the living\\nroom with the others. The experience continued to intensify over the\\nnext hour in intermittent waves. I had to verify that I was actually\\nin a physical room rather than in the music I was hearing. There was\\nnever any fear or panic, but I chose to retreat to a private place for\\nthe next couple of hours. Soon I started to feel worse and I tried to\\ngain some insight and relief from my negative attitude. I prayed, and\\nI cried, and I began to feel calmer and had more positive thoughts as\\nto how to deal with the others, but I was still afraid to go out into\\nthe group. I was afraid that my hopelessness would bother them but I\\neventually went back out at about the five hour point and the rest of\\nthe day was spent pleasantly and smoothly. I took 2.5 g of\\nL-tryptophan to sleep, and I slept well, waking twice.\"\\n\\n(with 160 µg) \"I pretreated myself with 40 milligrams of inderal 40\\nminutes beforehand, took the AL-LAD, and went to bed with eye-shades\\nand ear-phones. There was a very slow onset. The effects were best\\ndescribed as very short bursts of loss of contact with my body, which\\nbecame increasingly intense and frequent as things progressed. It\\nbecame really trippy, like acid. There were no visuals with my eyes\\nclosed, but when I removed my eye-shades the floors were melting, and\\nthe wall patterns and the wood ceiling really flowed. My body felt\\nvery blob-like, and I had to get help from my sitter to get up so I\\ncould pee. I was very affected by music. There was a very long\\ndown-ramp, with physical excitation appearing to linger longer than\\npsychic excitation. Pretty much out of it by 12 hours and I felt well\\nthe next day.\"\\n\\n(with 200 µg) \"This was taken on the tail end (seventh hour) of an\\nMDMA experience. I felt it quickly, but it never got to a super level.\\nComplicated erotic, good talking, looked pretty stoned, and yet I\\nstill had cognitive integrity.\"\\nEXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: This is one of the several very potent\\ncompounds in a large series of 5-alkylated analogues of nor-LSD.  Most\\nof them proved to be less potent than LSD, and considerably less\\ndramatic. The Inderal mentioned in one of the comments is a trade name\\nfor propranolol, an antihypertensive that reduces nervousness.\\n\\nA comment is appropriate concerning the use of the prefix \"nor,\" as in\\nthe name of this material N-allyl-nor-LSD and of its immediate\\nprecursor, nor-LSD. Its exact meaning is that there is an alkylated\\nnitrogen atom somewhere that has lost an alkyl group. The original\\nterm is from the German phrase \"N-ohne-Radical\" meaning N (the\\nnitrogen) without the radical (meaning the alkyl group). The removing\\nof the N-methyl group of LSD to form the N-H counterpart is a text\\nbook example of this usage. Unfortunately its use has slopped over to\\nembrace the removal of an alkyl group from a heteroatom of any\\nsort. Recently I learned of a metabolite of ibogaine that has lost a\\nmethyl group from the indolic oxygen atom (a methoxy has become a\\nhydroxy) and the compound was called noribogaine. The correct term, to\\nretain the use of the parent ibogaine word in its name, would have\\nbeen desmethyl ibogaine. The removal of something is usually indicated\\nwith a \"de-\" or a \"des\" prefix ahead of the item that has been lost,\\nas in deoxy (or desoxy) ribonucleic acid, DNA, which is ribonucleic\\nacid (RNA) missing an oxygen atom.\\n\\n\\n[ Back]\\n[Main Index]\\n[Forward ]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n[ back to library ] \\xa0 [ back to books_online ] \\xa0 [ back to tihkal ]\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPlaceMenu(\"footer\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived by Erowid with permission of Publisher and Author \\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nModified\\xa0-\\xa0Feb 21, 2015\\n\\nDesign © 1995-2020 Erowid.org.
